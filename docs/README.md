1. [Introduction](#introduction)For years, the need to protect one’s property has become one of people’s main concerns. The sense of security and protection is one of those feelings that makes us comfortable and complements quality living.
Although there are existing solutions for home security like video surveillance cameras, alarms etc., they are very expensive, and the installation process is also not easy.
Most of the existing security system solutions address the needs of the people who are living in private houses. But people who live in apartments in urban areas have some added needs to be satisfied with a particular security system.
Therefore, addressing all these issues along with some added unique features we have come up with the idea of a Smart Apartment Security System. Smart Apartment security system is a system that secure entry points, like doors and windows, as well as interior spaces in an apartment from a burglary or a fire by notifying the owners and security officer at the apartment gate whenever a threat has been identified through a mobile application.
The security system will consist of
·       
Door and window sensors
·       
Smoke detector
·       
Siren
·       
Smart door lock
·       
Control unit
·       
Mobile application
